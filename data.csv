I can't make any real suggestions on improvement - I wondered if the section statistics should be later on, or a subsection of """"types of accidents""""  -I think the references may need tidying so that they are all in the exact same format ie date format etc. I can do that later on, if no-one else does first - if you have any preferences for formatting style on references or want to do it yourself please let me know.

There appears to be a backlog on articles for review so I guess there may be a delay until a reviewer turns up. It's listed in the relevant form eg Wikipedia:Good_article_nominations#Transport  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Fair use rationale for Image:Wonju.jpg

Thanks for uploading Image:Wonju.jpg. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the boilerplate fair use template, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use.

Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale.

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the """"my contributions"""" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting """"Image"""" from the dropdown box. Note that any fair use images uploaded after 4 May, 2006, and lacking such an explanation will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on criteria for speedy deletion. If you have any questions please ask them at the Media copyright questions page. Thank you. (talk • contribs • ) 
Unspecified source for Image:Wonju.jpg

Thanks for uploading Image:Wonju.jpg. I noticed that the file's description page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the copyright status is unclear. If you did not create this file yourself, then you will need to specify the owner of the copyright. If you obtained it from a website, then a link to the website from which it was taken, together with a restatement of that website's terms of use of its content, is usually sufficient information. However, if the copyright holder is different from the website's publisher, then their copyright should also be acknowledged.

As well as adding the source, please add a proper copyright licensing tag if the file doesn't have one already. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the  tag can be used to release it under the GFDL. If you believe the media meets the criteria at Wikipedia:Fair use, use a tag such as  or one of the other tags listed at Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair use. See Wikipedia:Image copyright tags for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.

If you have uploaded other files, consider checking that you have specified their source and tagged them, too. You can find a list of files you have uploaded by following [ this link]. Unsourced and untagged images may be deleted one week after they have been tagged, as described on criteria for speedy deletion. If the image is copyrighted under a non-free license (per Wikipedia:Fair use) then the image will be deleted 48 hours after . If you have any questions please ask them at the Media copyright questions page. Thank you. (talk • contribs • ) """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Now, the edit itself is relevant-this is probably the single most talked about event int he news as of late. His absence is notable, since he is the only living ex-president who did not attend. That's certainly more notable than his dedicating an aircracft carrier. 
I intend to revert this edit, in hopes of attracting the attention of an admin that is willing to look at the issue itself, and not throw accusations around quite so liberally. Perhaps, if you achieve a level of civility where you can do this, we can have a rational discussion on the topic and resolve the matter peacefully.",0,0,0,0,0,0

 our previous conversation 

you fucking shit eating liberal, you make lady bird johnson shake on her tampon. I said fucking sorry for my little brother and you still had to fucking complain. My life is fucking shit. My mother is always yelling at me and my dad beats the shit out of me if I get fucking out of line. My brother's one outlet is wikipedia. He cried when he saw my father smacking me, and his tears clogged his mac book pro's keyboard. we had to go to fucking apple and get a new one, all out of my mom's pocket. then last night i wanted to take this hot pussy from connecticut out in my dad's new rolls-royce and he said fucking no. so you know what I fucking did? I fucking cut his pinky off and didnt snitch like a little bitch like you. I take lazy ass niggers like you and stomp you with my fat nazi heel. you should be FUCKING sorry you ever fucked with me or my dad (Steve Jobs). And if I find out your using Linux, I'll take pity on thee. Cause you're just too stupid to understand shit. i can see your fucking at some fucking computer and you think that you have some power on this fucking site. let me tell you something you little bitch. when i'm doing coke off strippers titties in da clubz, you can just edit some fucking wikipedia articles. i smoke a phat blunt every damn day, and you smoke your mom's fucking tea. So, in closing, as Shakespeare said in Sonnet ninety-four (I believe): """"things turn sourest by their deeds. Lillies that fester smell far worse than (fucking) weeds.""""
fuck you and heil hitler.

ps- if you ever fucking ban this ip again, there is going to be some serious shit thats gonna happen. i know a fucking guy.""",1,0,1,0,1,1
